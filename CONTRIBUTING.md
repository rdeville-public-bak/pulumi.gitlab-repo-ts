## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push it
to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will most
likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.

For more information, you can refers to the main [developers
guides][developers_guides] which is the common resources I use for all
my projects. There you will find:

  * [Syntax Guide][syntax_guide], which describe syntax guidelines per language
    to follow if you want to contribute.
  * [Contributing workflow][contributing_workflow], which provide an example
    of the workflow I used for the development.
